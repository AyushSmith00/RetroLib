# 🎮 RetroLib

**RetroLib** is a UI component library for those who refuse to live in the present.  
Bring back the **CRT glow**, the **pixel grit**, and the **terminal aesthetic** — inside modern React apps.

This isn't "vintage inspired".  
This is **full send retro**.

## 🚀 What is This?

RetroLib gives you pre-styled UI components that look like they came straight out of:

- an 80s arcade machine,
- a CRT green terminal,
- or a hacker den from a movie where people type really fast.

If your UI looks too clean and corporate, this will fix it.
